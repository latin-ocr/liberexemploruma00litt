Professor W. P. Ker has kindly supplied me with a sum-
mary of an article on this passage which appeared in Danske
Studien 1907, p. 175, entitled ‘Kvindegilde i Middelalderen:
en Graamunks Vidnesbyrd fra 13de Aarh.‚’ and signed ‘J. O.
og A. O.’ (Axel Obrik). The story is given from Paul Meyer
and translated. There is no reason to doubt the accuracy of
the English friar’s report. The story agrees with the ‘ Kone-
barsel' or ‘Kvindegilde’ custom : a party of women gathering
in the house after a birth. The women drink themselves merry,
then they dance, then they go in a rout and break into houses,
and revel along the street, ‘and make every man dance with
them, and take the breeches off him, or in more recent times
more frequently the hat'. Lively descriptions are given in
Feilberg’s Fra Hedera-⁴ see also Feilberg's Dz‘ctz'onary of the
Jutland Dialect, s.V. ‘Konebarsel’ (where the date 1862 is
given for an instance of the custom). And in Holberg’s Barsel-
stue (The Lying-in) there are relies of this sort of thing.

The straw-doll is known in harvest and Yuletide games.
Stories of the ‘Yule-buck' (julebukken, a straw-man dressed
with parti-coloured ribbons and kept in the house at Yuletide)
turning into a live devil are given in F eilberg, suffit, 229-38
(in the Dictionary‚ s.v. ‘Julebuk‚’ he refers to a Jutland story
of a girl who danced with the Yulebuck and was taken by the
devil : Skattegraveren, v.‚ iii, 75). But the straw-man at the
lying-in revels is elsewhere unknown.

‘ Bovi’ seems to be the typical Man. It might be held that
the later custom, of the women’s rout compelling rnen to dance,
is really the origina13 that the straw-man takes the place of
the casual real victims. On the other hand, it is also possible
that Bovi comes from old phallic customs. Antiquities and
written documents show that phallic images were known in the
North. Cf. Adam of Bremen on Upsala : image of Fricco (Frey)
‘ cum ingenti priapo,’ etc. (Pal. Lat. cxlvi, 643).—-Bovi is known
