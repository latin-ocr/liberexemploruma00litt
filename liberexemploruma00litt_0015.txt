INTRODUCTION ix

The date of the composition of the bookcan be
approximately fixed. The writer’s allusion to Walter
de Burgh as ‘nunc comes Ultonie' (1 17) suggests that
it was written not later than 1271, but nunc can easily
be a slip for tunc. The allusion to Odo Rigaldi ‘tunc
temporis archiepiscopi v Rothomagensis ⁷ (67) suggests
that Odo, who occupied the archiepiscopal see from
1248 to 1275, was dead. The reference to Thomas
O'Quinn, Bishop of Clonmacnois (1252-1279)‚ almost
certainly implies that he was still alive (142). We
may with confidence conclude that the work was
written between 1270 and 1279, probably between
1275 and 1279.

The author nearly always mentions the sources
from which his anecdotes are drawn. His authorities
are generally well-known books. Sometimes he draws
from his personal experience, from conversations with
his friends, from sermons he has heard.1 We thus
get a little evidence as to the process *by which stories
were disseminated.' An eastern tale about Alexander
the Great is quoted by Albert Suerbeer, the German
Archbishop of Armagh‚ in a sermon in Ireland (146).
Friar Peter, the Danish visitor of the Friars Minor in
Ireland, narrates to the convent in Dublin a strange
custom which prevailed in his country (192) ; and other
instances might be adduced which illustrate the in-
fiuence of the centralised organisation of the Mendicant
Orders in promoting the interchange os ideas and
experiences (eg. 44, 136).

The following list of books and authors used by the
compiler will give a fair idea of his literary equip-
ment :—
