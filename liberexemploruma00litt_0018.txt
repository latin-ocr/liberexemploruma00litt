xii INTRODUCTION

to exist, and the extracts given by our friar enable us
in one or two cases to emend the text of the printed
edition.1

lt has not been as yet possible to discover the
collection which the writer calls Exempla Communia,
and only one other reference has been found to the
Exempla Deodatz‘. In a MS. belonging to Balliol
College a story is quoted from this collection, and the
author is described as ‘Friar Deodatus formerly
minister of the Friars Minor of Ireland'.2

The omissions in our author’s list of authorities are
more startling. There is no reference to any classical
writer, nor to works so popular at this period as those of
BoethiuS‚ St. Bernard and Jacques de Vitry ; and the
resemblance which can occasionally be traced between
our Liber Exemplorum and the Speculum Hzlstorz'ale
of Vincent of Beauvais3 is probably due to the two
writers having made use of the same authorities. The
extent of the friar's reading compares very unfavour—
ably with that of Guillaume Peraud, or that of John of
Wales, or that of Stephen of Bourbon. On the other
hand, he is scrupulously honest :4 he does not pretend
to quote from books which he has not seen ; he would
be incapable of mistaking Barlaam for the author of
the romance of Barlaam and josaphat, as Friar
N icholas Bozon (among others) does.5

The writer sometimes appears to quote from
memory, eg. from the pseudo-Turpin's Gesta Caroli

⁴Good instances of his scrupulous accur-acy in referring to his sources of
information will be found in cap. 9 and 95.
