138 NOTES

The English sentence is carelessly written (‘hoede' for
‘eode')‚ and the abbreviated word ‘ungit' presents a difficulty.
Among various suggestions made by English scholars and
liturgiologists, the best is that of Professor Vaughan—namely,
that the word is ‘undergit‚' which would be a literal translation
of susceptis). The verb ‘undergitan,' however, does not appear
to have been used in the sense of ‘to take up' or ‘ to receive‚'
but in the figurative sense of ‘to understand ’. Of the noun
‘undergit,' formed on the analogy of ‘andgit‚' there seems to
be no example. The problem therefore remains unsolved.
(Mr. Madan suggests ‘wangel'.) ,

(63) The second book of the Dialogues contains the life of
St. Benedict: Pax. Lat. lxvi. This episode is quoted in Leg.
Aurea, 206; and Jo. W'allensis, De Vita Relzjgiosa, pars i., cap.

[nstz'tut. v., cap. 29 and 31 (Pat. Lat. xlix„ 246-8). The last
part, from ‘ Hic dicebat dyabolum? does not occur in Rosweyd’s
edition of the Vitae patrum, p. 550. The whole occurs in a
shorter form in the parabolae of Odo of Cheriton3 Hervieux,
Les Fabzclz'sles Latius ; Eudes de Clzerz‘lon (ed. 1896), p. 3423
and in Jo. Wallensis, De Vita Relzgz'osa, pars ii.‚ cap. 4 (fol.
291 in ed. of 1496).
