carried him off by force (1 17). It was probably after
this that our author was sent as a student to Paris.
Here he knew Roger Bacon, and took part with him
in a magica] seance (38). Another reference to his life -
in Paris helps to fix the date more nearly. “How
horrible contentions and divisions are‚’' he sayS, “is
shown by an example told me by F riar Bonaventura of
Tuscauy, then my fellow-student at Paris. For he
said that a magician‚ having once summoned his demon
whom he was accustomed to consult and to talk to,
asked him if he knew anything of Merlin. The demon
replied: ‘Your Merlin I knew quite well. And in
the near future‚’ he said, ‘Britain will fiourish under
Edward (super Edwardo) as it did under Merli11.'
Now this was some years before the war in England
in which Simon de Montfort of blessed memory was
slain ’' (104). It is most likely that Friar Bonaventura
(probably Bonaventura de Mugello) told the author this
story when the civil war had already broken out, and
that he was in Paris about 1264 or 1265. (The words
super Edwardo I take to be a slip for sub Henrz'co.)
It is certain that Roger Bacon was in Paris at this time.

It was perhaps after his sojourn in Paris that the
author became leclor in the convent at Cork. ⁶ Seven
years ago,⁷ he writeS‚ ‘an honest and religious widow
was murdered at Carrigtohill‚ near Cork, where I then
performed the duty of lecturer. This woman during
the war which then raged in Wales had fied from the
land of the lord David de Barry the elder in wales,
where she had before lived, to the same lord in Ireland,
and received from him a burgage at Carrigtohill, where

she brewed' (62). David de Barry was justiciar of
Ireland in 1267.
