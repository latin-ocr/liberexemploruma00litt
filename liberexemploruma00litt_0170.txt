132 NOTES

The Annales de Monte Fernandz' (Irish Archaeol. Soc.), com-
piled probably by Stephen of Exeter‚ a Franciscan in Ireland,
c. 1274, agree with the Chronica brevia: ‘obiit beata Virgo
Maria anno vite sue lxiii’ ; and the same figures are given in
Ballio] Coll. MS. 228, fol. 276.

(40) ‘Quia multi libri: etc.‚ cf. Evang. sec. soan. xxi, 2 5.-
The author gives here only three of the six exempla which he
promises from the ‘Libellus de miraculis B.V.M.' (the other
three may perhaps be cap. 52, 53, 54). Ihave not identified
this collection, but it seems to have been used by Gautier de
Coincy, Vincent of Beauvais (under the title ‘Mariale Mag-
num ')‚ Jac. de Voragine in the Lag. Αανεα, and, as Professor
Ker informs me, by the compiler of the Icelandic Μανία Saga
(ed. Unger, 1871).—This story of the clerk of Chartres (which
does not occur in the ‘Miracula in Carnotensi ecclesia' printed
in the Bibl. de l'Ecole des Clzartes, xlii„ 508-50) appears in
two forms in Gautier de Coincy, Les Mz'racles de la Saz'nte
Vierge, ed. Poquet, 295, 3633 also in the Μανία Saga, p. 74 3
in Balliol Coll. MSS. 228 (fol. 316), 230 (fol. 129); and in
Legrand d’Aussy, bkzblz'aux (ed. 1781), iv„ 12 (where the
Virgin calls the clerk her ‘chevalier ’)‚ Cs- the story of the
‘priest of a certain parish and of respectable life' in Leg. Aurea,
p. 592-33 and in Gautier de Coincy, op. cit. 359. See also
Thom. Cantiprat.‚ Bonum Um‘versale de Apibus (Duaci, 1597),
p. 543 ; Vincent of Beauvais‚ spec. Hz'st. (ed. 1624), lib. vii„
cap. 116.

(41) In Μανία Saga, p. 733 and Leg. Aurea, p. 513, with
some variations. The last part, from ‘Audiens hoc' to the end,
is not in Leg. Aurea. The antiphon is attributed to Anselm:
Pat. Lat. clviii„ 1046. The version there printed differs from our
text: charitatem for claritatem ,· pietatis et mz'serz‘cordzoe inserted
after Gaude malms,- factura (as in our MS.) for creatura ,· pia
for perpetua. The version of the text is found in Balliol Coll.
MSS. 230, fol. 128b, 228, fol. 216b. For other references see
Chevalier‚ Reperti Hymnol.

(42) This example occurs almost in the same words in
Wright's Latin Storz'es, no. 109 (from MS. Sloane, 2478, fol.
3b); and Vincent of Beauvais‚ spec. Hz'st. lib. vii, cap. 116
