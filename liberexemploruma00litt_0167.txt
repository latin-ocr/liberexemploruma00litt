NOTEs 129

(17) This consists of extracts from two Chapters of the
Gemma Eccles.

(18) From the Dialogues of Gregory the Great. The
author probably rearranged his extracts without altering the
introductory words. Quoted also in Vinc. of Beauvais, Spem
Hz'st. lib. xxii„ cap. 99; in cap. 100 of the same the next two
exempla (19 and 20) are given from Gregory.

(21) This does not appear to have been taken directly from
the lives of John the Patriarch printed in the Vitae Palmam, and
in Acta Sanctorum (ed. 1863), Jan.‚ tom. iii.‚ p. 121-2‚ 1393 nor
from the excerpts in Vinc. of Beauvais, op. cit. xxii„ Ι 10.

(22) See Introduction.

(23) Vita S. Bernam'z· auctore Guillelmo olim S. Theoderici
prope Remos abbate, lib. i., cap. xii. (Acta Sanctorum, Aug,
tom. iv., p. 272, §633 ed. 1867) ; auctore Alam, cap. xiii. (PL.
clxxxv„ 491). The passage occurs also in Leg. Aurea (ed.
Graesse)‚ p. 5 3 3; Jo. wallensis, Communz'loquz'um, pars vii„ dist.
ii., cap. 5.

(24) This episode is referred to in the biographies of St.
Edmund Rich, by Bertrand, Eustace, Robert Bacon and Robert
Rich: see Martene and Durand, T hes. Nov. Anecd. iii„ 1792 ;
W. Wallace, Life of St. Edmund of Canterbury (1893), p. 101,
552, 564, 607-8‚ 618-9; Vinc. Bellov., Spec. Hz’st. xxxi„ cap.
76 (ed. 1624). Ι have not traced the quotation at the end.

(25) Gregory's story seems to have been very popular among
mediaeval preachers. See The Exempla Ofsacques de V itry, ed.
Crane, no. cxxx. and p. 189, and authorities there cited. Also
Eudes de Chariton, ed. Hervieux, p. 3033 and cap. 153 below.

(26) Gregory has an interesting addition—about the bishop
patting a nun on the back—which is not appropriate to this
exemplum and consequentlyomitted. Versions are found in
Gir. Cambrensis, Gemma Eccles. p. 101 ; The Exempla ofscchues
de Vz'try, ed. Crane, no. cxxxi. 3 Gul. Peraldi, Summa de V z‘cz'z's,

(27) From the Liber Gestorum Barlaam et Iosaphat,
attributed to John of Damascus: see B. joannis Damascem·
