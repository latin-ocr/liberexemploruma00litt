INTRODUCTION vii

one Peter of Ardene‚ a famous surgeon, well known to
all the clerks of Ireland‚ as ‘my fellow-countryman
and by birth my fellow-parishioner' (38).. These in-
dications point to Warwickshire. ‘Aruleia' is pro-
bably Arley, and ‘Honestleia' the neighbouring
village of Astley in the north of the county. Many
years of his life were, however, spent in Ireland.
‘ There was once in Ireland one of our friars who was
still alive after my arrival in that country' (166). Our
author probably entered a religious order before he left
England, and this order was that of the Friars Minor.
He nowhere mentions this direcdy, nor is there in the
extant part of the book a single reference to St.
Francis. But he refers to Friar Adam Habe as
‘custos meus’ (95), a title only found in the Fran-
ciscan Order, and to Thomas O'Quinn‚ Franciscan
bishop of Clonmacnois‚ as ‘frater ordinis nostri' (142).
At one time he appears to have lived in the friary at
Drogheda (180). He was an Inmate of the convent
at Dublin when Alan de la Zouche was justiciar of
Ireland—z'.e. between 1256 and 1258. At this time
the Dublin friam-⁴⁶ me presente et consilium heu!
prebente ⁹—had admitted the young David de Burgh,
brother of Walter Earl of Ulster‚ to the Order, and the

earl with a body of armed men came to the friary and

who, as he told me himself (and 1 had every confidence in his truthfulness)‚
went once by night from Astley, the village where my father lives7 to a neigh-
bouring village called Arley, to a concubine whom he had there—and she was
also at that time well enough known to me. As he was going along alone

with his sword hung round his neck, he saw a large dog going in front of him.
He wondered much at the appearance of the dog, but more wonderful was what

he soon heard. For the dog turned round and said to him fiercely in English:
‘Give me your sword! ' He, putting his hand on his sword, with a brave
heart replied more fiercely in English : ⁴ You lie, by the death of Christ! '
Whereupon that which appeared to be a dog, but was really the devil in the
sorm of a dog, at once disappeared, not able to endure the power of the glorious
death of Christ even when mentioned by the mouth of a sinner.’'
