Troyes used the story, in the twelfth century, in the romance of
the Clzevalier au lion (ed. Holland‚ 1902, p. 150: verse 3335

of Gul. Peraldi, Summa (fol. 90), and is probably quoted second-
hand by our friar.

custodies in the fourteenth century were Dublin, Drogheda,
Cashel‚ Cork and N enagh: Eubel, provinciale Vetustz'ssz'mum.
A list of provinces dated 1 316 gives the number of Irish custodies
