the bishop arrived there was no evidence against the
abbess‚ who was saved from disgrace (54). ,

The Virgin of the thirteenth century generally
pleads for mercy against the severity of her Son’s
judgments.1 In the older story of St. Carpe (29),
the Saviour Himself comes down from His heavenly
throne and rescues two heretics from the torments of

hell.

The virtue of mercy is illustrated by two striking
stories : in each a knight meets the slayer of his father
and forgives him for the love of Christ; and the
image of the crucifix bows down and kisses the merci-
ful knight (211, 212).

Twice the writer quotes the tale of the two good
wives, whose holiness surpassed that of ‘the abbot
Macarius praying in his cell’ (101, 188).

These stories are not peculiar to the present collec-
tion: they are found again and again in the manuals
and sermons of the time ; and their widespread popu-
larity rather increases than diminishes their historical
significance.

Other exempla are of a more individual character
and are the result of the writer’s experience in Ireland.
Among these is the story of the bailiff of Turvey (95)
who while going along a lonely road one night saw a
horrible beast coming towards him. Knowing that it
was the devil, he made with his axe a circle of crosses
round him, and at once hastened to confess his sins'to
God. Forthwith there began to rise round him a wall
which grew with every sin confessed. Against this
