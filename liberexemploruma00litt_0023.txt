INTRODUCTION xvii

devils and say more things about them thanany one
else in the world. Here am I standing here and abusing
them as much as I know how. Do they do me harm ?
Let the devils come! Let them all -come ! Where are
they? Why don’t they come? ''' From that hour
the devils disappeared and the pestilence with them.

Elsewhere we get a curious glimpse of another
preaching tour in Ulster (166). Two friars were
followed from place to place by a multitude of people
‘ both for their sermons and for the indulgences which
they granted ’. Among their followers was a man who
accompanied them, amassing indulgences‚ till all his
money was spent. On his way home he obtained a
night's lodging from a householder. The latter, hear-
ing of all the indulgences he had secured, said: ‘I
should like to have an indulgence like that for my dead
son '. The other offered to sell all he had in return for
the amount which he had spent in getting them and a
pot of beer in addition. So the bargain was struck.
In the following night a shining spirit appeared to the
father, announcing, ‘ I am your son and may God bless
you as a good father, for the indulgences which you
have bought for me have freed me from punishment
and now I am going to heaven ⁷. The foolish seller,
realising the efficacy of the indulgenceS‚ tried to recover
them by returning the money.

Perhaps the most dramatic story in the book is that
of the delayed penance and the vanished castle (1 12),
recalling the Welsh legends of Llyn Syfaddon and
Kenfig Pool; and the interest to students of northern
folk-lore of the ‘Dacian custom⁷ told by Friar Peter of
Denmark (192) has been elsewhere recognised.1
