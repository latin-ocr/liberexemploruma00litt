Hunc diem, etc. The last line of the Whitsunday sequence,
which begins: ‘Sancti Spiritus assit nobis gloria‚' written by
N otker of St. Gall.

(104) Can Bonaventura of Tuscany be identified with St.
Bonaventura? Bagnorea was not in Tuscany, though not far
from the borders. There are no serious chronological objec-
tions to the identification. Bonaventura entered the Order
probably in 1238, and after studying at Orvieto went to Paris
about 1242; he studied and taught here till 1255, and was
elected general minister in 1257; see Anal. Franc. iv.‚ 323,
note. It is, however, unlikely that our friar, writing during his
generalate, or soon after his death (1274), would describe him
merely as Friar Bonaventura of Tuscany. Three other Fran-
ciscans of this name come under consideration: Bonaventura
de F urlivio or Forli‚ who was an outspoken opponent of F riar
Elias, and whom Salimbene knew at Lyons in 1249: Salim'-
bene, Clzron„ ecl. Holder-Egger‚ 161, 322. Bonaventura de
Yseo, who went with* John of Parma to the Eastern Emperor
in 1249 (Salimbene‚ op. cz‘t. 322; Anal. Franc. iii„ 277), and
who was a student of necromancy and alchemy (Ambivium
Francz'sc. i.‚ 116-7). Bonaventura de Mugello, who was one
of the socz'z' of Friar Jerome of Ascoli on his mission to the
Greeks in 1273 (ibid. 3523 Ball. Franc. iii„ p. 191). Forli is
in the province of Bologna3 Yseo is in Lombmdy, near
Brescia; Mugello is a division of Tuscany, to the north of
Florence. Bonaventura de Mugello is probably the friar re-
ferred to here. Ι have not found any other mention of him.

Super Edwardo: one would naturally expect sub Henrico
(cf. the sub z'llo below). The prophecy might easily have been
made any time between 1258 and 1265, but it is evident that
the story was written down after the accession of Edward I.

(105) Balrothery‚ barony and parish in the north of co.
Dublin.
