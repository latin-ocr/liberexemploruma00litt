INTRODUCTION xiii

Magni (60, 137), and it may be that when compiling
his work he had access only to few books, But it is
perhaps not irrelevant to point out that his only two
references to his student life in Paris are concerned
with stories of magic.

Apart srom a few sententiae, the book consists of
exempla or narraz‘z'ones as distinguished both from
sables and from moralised stories from natural history.
Sometimes the writer adds a few words to point the
moral—generally sufficiently obvious—of his tale‚' but
he has little taste for allegory. His exempla are
directed ‘to the utility and edification of the people‚
announcing to them vices and virtues, punishment and
glory‚'1 and so far at any rate are in accordance with
the rule of St. Francis.

One cannot fail to be struck by the absence of all
allusions to F ranciscan ideaIS, legends and literature.
A similar peculiarity may be observed in the Summa
of the Dominican Guillaume Peraud, and it may be
due to the fact that· these works of the Mendicant
Friars were intended for the use of all kinds of
preachers. It has its good side. There is no trace
in our friar of jealousy of or antagonism to other Orders
or the secular clergy.2 His relations to individua]
Dominicans were cordial‚ and his references to them
are conceived in the most friendly spirit.3 He cautions
preachers, if they are preaching to the people‚ to alter
stories reflecting on the morals of monks, so as to
make them of more general application: otherwise the

1Ru1e of St. Francis (1223), chapter 9.

2He mentions incidentally that a parish priest referred 3 difficult case,
which he felt incapable of dealing with, to the friars (99). Can this be regarded
as typical of the relations between the friars and parish priests in Ireland at
this time ?
