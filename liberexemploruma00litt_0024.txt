xviii INTRODUCTION

N aturally the book does not add much to our
knowledge of events. The armed attack on the Dublin
convent has already been noticed. A few new names
may be added to the lists of Dominican and Franciscan
writers, From one incidental reference it seems prob—
able that a Provincial Prior of the Friars Preachers in
England———Simon de Henton—has been placed a
century too late by the historians of the Order (51).—
Lastly‚ the allusions to the high wages of ‘ those
employed clean out the latrines in great cities' (208)
may be of interest to the student of mediaeval town-
life.

In conclusion, Ι desire to acknowledge the obliga—
tions of the Society to the Dean and Chapter of Dur-
ham for permission to print the Liber Exemplorum, and
personally to express my warmest thanks to Dean
Kitchin‚ whose kind help and hospitality turned the
task of copying the MS. into a pleasure.
