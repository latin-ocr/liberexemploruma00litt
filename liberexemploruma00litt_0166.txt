128 NOTES

(9) This exemplum does not occur in the Gemma Ecclesi-
astz'ca. Ι can give no explanation of ‘qui dicitur Marimi'.
There are places of the name of Doddington or Dodington in
many counties in England. F riar Robert is mentioned again
in cap. 166. On the Exempla Communia, which Ι have not
identified, see Introduction.

I have not noted the story elsewhere. For variants of the
miracle, see Vincent of Beauvais, op. cit. lib. vii., cap. 84, ‘ De
clerico cui virgo lac infundens linguam restauravit' ; and Balliol
College MSS. 228 (fol. 314a)‚ 230 (fol. 130b).

(10) Urbs Atrabatensz's, Arras. The quotation follows the
Gemma Eccles. almost word for word, excepting some slight
alterations at the end.

(11) The compiler or scribe has omitted a few words in
this passage without altering the sense. Maurice de Sully-sur-
Loire‚ Bishop of Paris 1160, died 11th Sept„ 1196. The
Gemma Eccles. probably contains the earliest extant version
of this story, which is found also in the Summa ascribed to
Rob. de Courcon (Haureau, Notices et Extraz‘ts, xxxi„ ii.‚
273), in Caesarius of Heisterbach, Mirac. (ed. 1591), lib. ix., cap.
43, and elsewhere. Cf Oudin, De Scrzpt. Eccles. ii., col. 1587.

(12) Of Richard of Auboey, Giraldus adds another fact—-
after dicebatur: ‘de sententia enirn illa (zze. eukaristia) multos
habens auditores principaliter in urbe legebat’: Gemma Eccles.
P· 33-

(13) Urban ΙΙΙ. (1185), ‘third pope from Alexander III.,'
reckoning in both Alexander and Urban.

The text differs somewhat from the printed text of Gemma
Ecdes„ the words ‘secundum—pretendebant' being inserted,
and the words ‘transmittere non valebat' being substituted for
‘non transmiserat vel debilitate nimia vel de causa nobis in-
cognita'. The passage from ‘Nos autem causam' to the end

is not found in Gemma Eccles.

(16) The story occurs in a somewhat different form in ,

Etienne de Bourbon, no. 317 (ed. Lecoy de la Marche), who
begins his account: ‘Item audivi et legi metrice dictatum
exemplum quoddam ’. The metrical version does not appear

to be extant.
