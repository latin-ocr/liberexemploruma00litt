ut intrarent monasterium Clarevallense '. Cf. Gautier de Coincy‚
op. cit. col. 515. ’

(50) Α similar story is told of Alan, prior of the Friars
Preachers of York 3 Gerard. de Fracheto, Vitae Fratrum (ed.
Reichert)‚ 277-78. This and cap. 208 may be the reminiscences
of the Dominican Vitae Fratrum.

(51) Leg. Aurea, p. 593, has an abbreviated version. Cf.
also Thom. Cantiprat.‚ Bonum Unz'v. de Apibus (ed. 1597), lib.
ii., cap. xxix„ 10 (p. 232), and Les Contes moralz'se's de Nz'cole
Bozon, no. 45. The F riar Minor whose book is mentioned is
perhaps John of Kilkenny: see cap. 136. Of Friar Gilbert,
O.P., Ι know nothing more. One Simon de Heinton or Henton
is said to have been provincial prior of the English Dominicans
about 1360: Bale, script. i., 4473 Pits, 4873 Quetif Echard,
Scrzpt. Ord. Praed. i., 648; Tanner, Bz'bl. 397. There is,
however, no authority for the date. On the other hand
the provincial prior who was deposed in 1261 was named Simon
(he was sent to Germany but was permitted to return in 1262) :
Mon. Ord. Praed. Hz'st. (ed. Reichert), iii„ 110, 117. I am
inclined to think that Bale and his sollowers have placed Simon
de Henton exactly a century too late, and to identify the Simon
de Heynton mentioned in the text with the provincial prior.
(Some of his works are preserved in New Con„ Oxi, MS.
45.)

Ι take this opportunity to make some additions to the list of
Dominican Provincial Priors which appeared in the Engl. H ist.
Rev. viii. On the deposition of Richard de Wynkele in 1339
(Close 14 Ed. ΙΙΙ., pt. i., m. 27d), Hugh Dutton (Sutton ?) was
appointed Vicar of the Master-general (Quetif Echard, Scmpt.
i., p. 595), but it is uncertain whether he was elected prior.
Gregory de S. Michael occurs as provincial prior in July‚ 1350
(Reg. Rad. de Salopz'a, in ‘ Somerset Record Soc.,' vol. X„
p. 639) ; John de Tatenhall as ‘S.T.P. and provincial ’ in 1361
(Cal. Papal Petimus, i., 37o); Rob. Pynk as provincial prior
in 1364 (Cal. ofLetler Books of the Cz'ty ofLondon, G„ p. 1 17 ;
Sharpe, Cal. of Wz'llsproved in tlze court of Hustz'ng‚ ii.‚ 36) ;
William de Bodekysham as provincial prior in 1370 (Pat. 44,
Edw. ΙΙΙ., pt. i., m. 14d; P.R.O. Chancery Warrants‚ file
