and the end of the work—perhaps a third of the whole
——are missing. The extant part consists of seven
regular quires of twelve leaves each.1

The book is a manual for the use of preachers,
and is divided into two parts The first part treats

colophon. He was an Englishman by birth, probably
of Warwickshire. His father lived—and was appar-
ently still living when the work was composed—at
‘Honestleia,' near ‘Aruleia' (22),2 and he mentions
