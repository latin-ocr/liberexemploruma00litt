130 NOTES

Opera (Basel, 1675), p. 881-2. Cf. abridgement in Leg. Aurea
(ed. Graesse), p. 821-2.

(29) From the letter to Demophilus attributed to Dionysius
the Areopagite. It is often quoted by moralists about this
period: eg. by Jac. de Voragine, Leg. Aurea (ed. Graesse),
2 37-83 by William de Wadington and his translator Rob. de
Brunne; see Rob. de Brunne’s Handlyng Synna (Roxb.
Club), 164-73 cf Hz'st. Lz'tt. de la ance, xxviii„ 199; by Nic.
Bozon, Les Contes moralz'se‘s (ed. P. Meyer), no. 79.

Our author has not altered the original so much as he
seems to imply3 such changes as he has made are in the
direction of simplicity. Eg. the passage ‘circa pedes eorum
volventes‚' etc„ appears in the original as ‘circa tam labiles
illorum pedes, modo quidem in gyro actos, et implicitos simul
pertrahentes, modo,' etc.

(30) The spurious epistle of S. Jerome adds the words
‘sine virili commixtione ’ after ‘sine corruptione '.

(31) I do not know who the philosopher was. Richard
Fishacre, O.P., died at Oxford, Ι248; Quetif-Echard, Scrz'pt.
Ord. Praed. i., 118; Εἰσί. Nat. Bz'og. xix, 53. The only work
of his extant seems to be his commentaries on the Sentences ;
MSS. Ealliol Coll. 573 Oriel Coll. 31, 43.

(32) Cf. Leg. Aurea, p. 42, where the legend is given on the
authority of Innocent III. (zze. ‘Sermones de Sanctis II.’ Pat.
Lat. ccxvii„ 457), and the words added: ‘ibi est modo ecclesia
S. Marie Novae'. Jo. Wallensis, Compendiloquium, pars viii„
cap. 2 (fol. 225 in ed. Venet.‚ 1496), mentions the story, adding:
‘Hec ibi idem narrat Hugo superaddens quod illud palatium
dicebatur Coliseum’.

(33) The Church of S. Maria in Trastevere. The spring of
oil is mentioned by Orosius, Hz'st. lib. vi., cap. 20 (Pat. Lat.
xxxi„ 105 3); Leg. Aurea, p. 43; Gregorovius, Geschz'chte der
stadt Rom, i., 260.

(34) I do not know what is meant by ‘Athanasius in libro
de constitutionibus primitive ecclesie '.

The Leg. Aurea, p. 44, gives versions of the legend from
Innocent HL, Orosius, Eutropius and Timotheus.
