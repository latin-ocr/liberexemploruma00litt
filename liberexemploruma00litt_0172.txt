Adana in Cilicia, was the ‘Faust of the Middle Ages’. On
the literature about him see Chevalier, Repertom des sources
historiques, Bia-Bibliogr. col. 4439. Our author has taken the
story from the Summa Virtutum ac Vitiorum of Guillaume
Peraud, lib. i.‚ pars ii„ tract. iii„ cap. 3 (fol. 75b in ed. 1519).
The Lag. Aurea, p. 593, quotes the legend from Fulbert of
Chartres (‘ Sermones ad populum,' Pal. Lat. cxli.⁹ 323), but adds
the detail that Theophilus wrote his compact with the devii
suo sanguiue proprio. Metrical versions are extant by Gautier
de Coincy (ed. Poquet, 601. 29), Ruteboeuf (ed. Jubinal, 1839),
and others: see Douhet‚ Dici. des Lag-andes, 1169-76. (Vincent
of BeauvaiS, spec. Hist. xxi„ cap. 69, 70 (ed. 1624), gives the
story on the authority ‘Sigebertus ex Mariali ’.)

(48) Α version of the story, differing in some details, will
be found in Leg. Aurea, p. 591. Cf. Warner‚ M z'racles de Nostra
Dama (Roxb. Club)‚ no. lxiii.; Caesar. Heisterb.‚ splirac. lib.
